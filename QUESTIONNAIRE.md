1. At first I tried handling all the REST API with python, returning just the values I need to the javascript, but in the end decided to just hadle everything in javascript
2. The auto updating prices might be an over-design because it wasn't stated in the instruction
3. Increase the time between the calls for updating prices to the api to reduce load
4. i would have setup a server to handle the requests to and from the client and api so that I can do more with the data in the future. Also I would have made the CSS nicer
