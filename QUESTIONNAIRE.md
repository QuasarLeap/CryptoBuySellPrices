1. At first I tried handling all the REST API with python, returning just the values I need to the javascript, but in the end decided to use Spring
2. The auto updating prices might be an over-design because it wasn't stated in the instruction
3. Increase the time between the calls for updating prices to the api to reduce load
4. I would have made it to be able to support more currencies and not just bitcoin and ethereum. Also I would have made the CSS nicer
